<h1>CONSTRUCTION AND
OPERATION</h1><br><hr width="90%"><a name=""></a>The cruise control section in engine-ECU calculates the cruise control system
operation condition based on the signals sent from switches and sensors. Based on the calculation,
the cruise control section outputs the target accelerator pedal opening angle signal to the
engine control section, and shift control signal to A&#0047;T-ECU and cruise control status
(ON&#0047;OFF, etc.) to the combination meter, respectively.<br><b></b><br><ul>
<li>In the engine control section, the target throttle valve opening angle is
calculated based on the target accelerator pedal opening angle signal from the cruise control
section and the actual accelerator pedal opening angle signal from the accelerator pedal position
sensor, and the vehicle speed is controlled by operating the throttle valve control servo &#0060;6B3&#0062;. <br></li>
<li>In the engine control section, the amount of fuel consumption is calculated based
on the target engine torque signal from the cruise control section and the actual accelerator
pedal opening angle signal, and the vehicle speed is controlled by controlling the fuel injection
system &#0060;4N1&#0062;.<br></li>
</ul>The combination meter will turn on the cruise control display screen when the cruise control
system is active. "SET" symbol will also appear in the screen during constant speed driving.<br><b>BLOCK DIAGRAM</b><br><a href="javascript:enlarge('http://mmc-manuals.ru/manuals/pajero_sport_iii/online/Service_Manual/img/17/ACF00784AB00ENG.png')"><img width="505" src="http://mmc-manuals.ru/manuals/pajero_sport_iii/online/Service_Manual/img/17/ACF00784AB00ENG.png"></a><br><hr width="90%"><a name=""></a><h2>CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS</h2><br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>SET FUNCTION</h3><br><b>1.</b>While driving in the vehicle speed range of approximately 40 km&#0047;h or more,
press the SET&#0045; switch.<br><b>2.</b>The cruise control system stores the vehicle speed when the SET&#0045; switch is
released, and then performs a constant speed driving at the stored vehicle speed. <br><b>3.</b>When the SET&#0045; switch is operated while driving at the vehicle speed of high
speed limit or faster, the constant speed driving is not performed.<br><b>4.</b>When the SET&#0045; switch is operated while driving at the vehicle speed of low
speed limit (approximately 40 km&#0047;h) or slower, the constant speed driving is not performed.<br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>DECELERATION FUNCTION</h3><br><b>1.</b>When the SET&#0045; switch is pressed and held for approximately 0.5 second or
longer during the constant speed driving, the vehicle is decelerated by using engine braking
while the switch is pressed.<br><b>2.</b>After that the SET&#0045; switch is released, the vehicle speed of that time is
newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed. <br><b>3.</b>In addition, when the SET&#0045; switch is pressed for less than approximately
0.5 second, the vehicle speed is decreased by approximately 1.6 km&#0047;h from the constant
speed driving speed. The decelerated speed is newly stored, and then the constant speed driving
is performed at that speed.<br><b>4.</b>When the SET&#0045; switch is pressed and held, and the vehicle speed is decelerated
to low speed limit (approximately 40 km&#0047;h) , the low speed limit will be maintained.<br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>RESUME FUNCTION</h3><br><b>1.</b>During the constant speed driving, press the CANCEL switch, or depress the brake pedal
to cancel the constant speed driving. <br><b>2.</b>Afterward, when the RES &#0043; switch is pressed while driving at a vehicle speed
of low speed limit (approximately 40 km&#0047;h) or more, a constant speed driving is performed
at the vehicle speed stored when the constant speed driving was cancelled.<br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>ACCELERATION FUNCTION</h3><br><b>1.</b>During the constant speed driving, when the RES &#0043; switch is pressed and held
for approximately 0.5 seconds or longer, the vehicle is accelerated with the specified acceleration
while the switch is pressed.<br><b>2.</b>After that the RES &#0043; switch is released, the vehicle speed of that time is
newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed. <br><b>3.</b>In addition when the RES &#0043; switch is pressed for less than approximately
0.5 second, the vehicle speed is increased by approximately 1.6 km&#0047;h from the constant
speed driving speed. The accelerated vehicle speed is newly stored, and then the constant speed
driving is performed at that speed. <br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>CANCEL FUNCTION</h3><br>When any of the following conditions are satisfied, the constant speed driving will be
cancelled. <br><b></b><br><ul>
<li>The cruise control system is stopped by the pressing
the cruise control ON&#0047;OFF switch.<br></li>
<li>The CANCEL switch is pressed.<br></li>
<li>The brake pedal is depressed.<br></li>
<li>The selector lever is shifted to the "N" position.<br></li>
<li>The vehicle speed becomes low speed limit (approximately 40 km&#0047;h) or less. <br></li>
<li>The vehicle speed is decreased by 15 km&#0047;h or more from the setting vehicle
speed.<br></li>
<li>An abnormality occurs in the vehicle speed signal.<br></li>
<li>The ASTC is operated.<br></li>
<li>An abnormality occurs in A&#0047;T-ECU.<br></li>
<li>An abnormality occurs in the CAN communication.<br></li>
</ul><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>ACCELERATOR PEDAL OVERRIDE FUNCTION</h3><br>If the driver depresses the accelerator pedal while the vehicle is driven at constant
speed with the cruise control system activated, the vehicle will be accelerated further than
the set speed. Note that the system will resumes the set speed for constant-speed cruising when
the accelerator pedal is released.<br><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>FAIL-SAFE FUNCTION</h3><br>When one of the following conditions is met, the cruise control system function will be
suspended until the system returns to normal condition. Also, when one of the following conditions
is met, a constant speed driving is cancelled immediately. <br><br><b></b><br><ul>
<li>An abnormality occurs in the cruise control switches.<br></li>
<li>An abnormality occurs in the stop lamp signal.<br></li>
</ul>When one of the following conditions is met, unless the vehicle is stopped to turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position, the cruise control system function will be suspended
even if the system returns to the normal state. Also, one of the following conditions is met,
a constant speed driving is cancelled immediately. <br><b></b><br><ul>
<li>Engine-ECU abnormality.<br></li>
<li>An abnormality occurs in the vehicle speed signal.<br></li>
<li>Throttle position sensor abnormality.<br></li>
<li>Accelerator pedal position sensor abnormality.<br></li>
</ul><a name=""></a><hr width="70%">
<h3>DIAGNOSIS FUNCTION</h3><br>To ease the system inspection, the diagnosis code inspection, data list inspection is
available by M.U.T.-III.<br><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%">
